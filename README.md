# Graduate-Admission-Rates-Prediction

Multiple Regression Analysis - Excel

This project involved the use of regression analysis to predict the chances of graduate admissions for prospective students.

The project was divided into two main dataset: Training and Testing.


## Skills

Outliers using IQR, Regression Statistics, Predictive Analysis, p-value, error & residuals

## Tech-Stack

Microsoft Excel
## Training Dataset

- Data Preprocessing: The training dataset was preprocessed to remove outliers and ensure data quality.

- Regression Analysis: A regression model was trained on the preprocessed training dataset. The model was built to predict the chances of admission based on features such as GRE Score, TOEFL Score, Letter of Recommendation (LOR), CGPA, and Research experience.

- Model Training: The regression model was trained using the cleaned training data to capture the relationships between the input features and the target variable (Chance of Admit).
## Testing Dataset

- Data Preparation: The testing dataset was prepared for prediction, ensuring it had the same format and features as the training data.

- Regression Prediction: The trained regression model was applied to the testing data to make predictions for the chances of admission.

Made some assumptions and also calculated Mean Absolute Error(MAE) & Mean Absolute Percent Error(MAPE)
